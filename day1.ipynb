        "Exception handling in Python allows developers to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully, preventing abrupt termination of the program. Here's how exception handling works in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Try-Except Blocks:\n",
        "The primary mechanism for handling exceptions in Python is the try-except block.\n",
        "Code that may raise an exception is placed inside a try block.\n",
        "If an exception occurs within the try block, the program execution is immediately transferred to the corresponding except block.\n",
        "The except block contains code to handle the exception. It specifies the type of exception(s) it can handle.\n",
        "Handling Specific Exceptions:\n",
        "You can specify different except blocks to handle specific types of exceptions.\n",
        "This allows for targeted error handling based on the type of exception raised.\n",
        "If an exception matches the type specified in an except block, the corresponding block is executed.\n",
        "Handling Multiple Exceptions:\n",
        "You can handle multiple types of exceptions in a single except block by specifying them as a tuple.\n",
        "This allows for more concise exception handling.\n",
        "Handling Unspecified Exceptions:\n",
        "You can use a generic except block without specifying the type of exception.\n",
        "This block will catch any exception that is not handled by preceding except blocks.\n",
        "It's often used as a catch-all for unexpected errors.\n",
        "Finally Block:\n",
        "Optionally, you can include a finally block after the try-except blocks.\n",
        "The code inside the finally block is executed whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
        "It's commonly used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources, regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
        "Raising Exceptions:\n",
        "You can raise exceptions manually using the raise statement.\n",

        "When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.\n",

        "The next time next() is called, the function resumes execution from where it left off until it reaches the next yield statement or the end of the function.\n",

The GIL effectively serializes access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. This means that even in a multi-threaded environment, Python bytecode execution remains single-threaded.\n",

        "The GIL is a mutex (lock) that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously.\n",
        "Whenever a thread in a Python process wants to execute Python bytecode, it must acquire the GIL.\n",
        "Only the thread holding the GIL can execute Python bytecodes. Other threads must wait until the GIL is released before they can acquire it and execute bytecodes.\n",
        "Impact on Multi-Threading:\n",
        "Due to the GIL, multi-threaded Python programs do not fully leverage the benefits of multi-core processors for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "While Python threads are useful for I/O-bound tasks (such as network requests, disk I/O, etc.), they are less effective for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation.\n",
        "In a multi-threaded Python program, if one thread is executing CPU-bound tasks, it holds the GIL for an extended period, preventing other threads from executing Python bytecodes concurrently. This can lead to poor performance and CPU utilization in multi-core systems.\n",
        "Workarounds and Alternatives:\n",
        "To overcome the limitations of the GIL, Python developers often use alternative approaches such as:Using multiprocessing instead of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks. Multiprocessing allows multiple Python processes to run concurrently, each with its own GIL.\n",
        "Offloading CPU-bound tasks to external libraries or language extensions implemented in languages like C or C++ (e.g., NumPy, pandas) that do not have a GIL.\n",
        "Using asynchronous programming models such as asyncio and concurrent.futures for I/O-bound tasks, which allow multiple I/O-bound operations to run concurrently within a single thread.\n",
        "GIL in Python Implementations:\n",
        "It's important to note that the GIL is a characteristic of the CPython interpreter, which is the reference implementation of Python. Other implementations of Python, such as Jython (for Java) and IronPython (for .NET), may not have a GIL or may have different concurrency models.\n",
